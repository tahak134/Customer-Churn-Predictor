# ðŸ”® Customer Churn Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn â€” and does it in real time through a clean, interactive dashboard.

Built using Python, trained on real-world Telco data, and deployed with Streamlit Cloud. This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a data-driven product â€” from preprocessing and model training to deployment and user interaction.
